### Notes

I think what made this app slightly easier for me was that I have previously taken Codepath's Android course and so I was used to constraints and the idea of recycling views for a list of unknown size.

I think what was challenging is the setup of the tableview is drastically different than setup of a recyclerview in Android.  I cannot wait to learn more about navigation between views as the course goes on.
